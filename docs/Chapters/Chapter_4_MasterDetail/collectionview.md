In the previous section, we studied `ListView`, a commonly used view for displaying collections of data.

Since Xamarin.Forms 4.3, an alternative known as "Collection View" was introduced.

> From the [Microsoft Documentation on Collection View](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/collectionview/introduction)

> CollectionView is a view for presenting lists of data using different layout specifications. It aims to provide a more flexible, and performant alternative to ListView.
